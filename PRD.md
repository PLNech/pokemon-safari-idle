# Safari Zone Tycoon - PRD

## 🎯 Core Concept
**"You are the Safari Zone Manager"** - Build and manage the ultimate Pokemon Safari Zone experience. Start with a basic grass patch and grow into a legendary Pokemon preserve that attracts trainers from around the world.

## 🎮 Core Game Loop (60-second cycle)
1. **Attract Trainers** - Click Safari Bell, trainers arrive and pay entry fee
2. **Trainers Explore** - Auto-simulation of trainer journeys through areas
3. **Pokemon Encounters** - Trainers find Pokemon, use Bait/Rocks, attempt captures
4. **Revenue Generation** - Entry fees + item sales (Safari Balls, Bait, Rocks) + rare finds
5. **Reinvestment** - Upgrade facilities, stock Pokemon, unlock new areas
6. **Scale & Prestige** - Bigger facilities = rarer Pokemon = premium trainers = exponential growth

## 🎲 Three Core Minigames

### 1. Early Game: "Bell Rhythm Mastery" (Minutes 1-15)
**Mechanic**: Perfect timing clicks on the Safari Bell create "resonance" that attracts multiple trainers
- **Basic**: Click when bell glows = 1 trainer
- **Good**: Click during golden flash = 2 trainers + 10% bonus entry fee  
- **Perfect**: Chain 5 perfect clicks = "Trainer Caravan" event (8 trainers arrive)
- **Unlock**: Available from start, teaches core clicking mechanic

### 2. Mid Game: "Pokemon Population Panic" (15-60 minutes)
**Mechanic**: Rapid-fire resource management when Pokemon populations crash
- **Trigger**: When any area drops below 20% Pokemon capacity
- **Goal**: Restock 4 areas within 90 seconds while trainers are still exploring
- **Challenge**: Each area has different Pokemon that cost different amounts
- **Reward**: Successfully completed = 2x breeding speed for 5 minutes + achievement
- **Unlock**: After unlocking Area 2

### 3. End Game: "Legendary Migration Event" (1+ hour)
**Mechanic**: Real-time strategy during rare Pokemon migration events
- **Trigger**: Random event every 20-30 minutes in end game
- **Scenario**: Wild legendary Pokemon (Articuno/Zapdos/Moltres) appears in random area
- **Challenge**: Direct trainers using "Guide Signals" to intercept the legendary
- **Complexity**: Must balance trainer flow, bait distribution, and timing
- **Reward**: If legendary is caught = massive prestige points + permanent park reputation boost
- **Unlock**: After collecting 100 total rare Pokemon
